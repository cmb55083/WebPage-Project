		<p>This page is dedicated to sharing my personal tips and tricks for pet care,and being able to appreciate animals in our local area.</p>
		I want to give recogniztion to the local animal heroes, our Athens animal shelters.
		The Athens Area Human Society is a non profit orginizations funded by donors.
		It is most importantly a no kill institution with goals of lowering euthenization.
		There are several people who can help: People who adopt, people who volunteer.
		Lastly the people who take their pets to a human place if they cant take care of their pets.
		This insitution plays a vital role with the community, and so can you.
		Donating, volunteering and taking in animals who are helpless.
		Some benefits are companionship as well as being able to say you saved them!In return later you might say they saved you
